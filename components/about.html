            <p>
                I am an active Informatics student at Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang with a strong passion for web
                development, particularly in frontend engineering. My focus lies in building clean, responsive, and
                user-friendly interfaces using TypeScript and modern JavaScript technologies such as Next.js. I
                believe in writing clean code, maintaining consistency, and delivering exceptional user experiences
                that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond frontend development, I have developed programming skills in Java, Python, and Flutter, which
                allow me to adapt to various software development environments and tackle diverse technical
                challenges. My development workflow is powered by essential tools like Git for version control,
                Figma for design collaboration, and VS Code as my primary development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of soft skills, I possess strong communication abilities, effective time management, and
                leadership qualities that enable me to collaborate successfully in both team-based projects and
                independent work settings. I am constantly learning and evolving, driven by curiosity and a
                commitment to excellence in everything I create.
